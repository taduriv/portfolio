**I worked at Amazon in multiple roles, both contract and full-time, which allowed me to progressively build and diversify my skills in operations, data analysis, and product quality. The transitions between these roles sometimes created short gaps, which I used productively to upskill and prepare for new challenges. This experience helped me adapt quickly, take on greater responsibilities, and develop a comprehensive expertise within the same organization.**

  <h3>ðŸ§  Evaluating Implicit Polarity of Events with CLIPEval</h3>
  <p><strong>Overview:</strong><br>
  This NLP project detects event types and their implicit (hidden) sentimentsâ€”positive, negative, or neutralâ€”in sentences. It uses the CLIPEval framework (SemEval 2015 Task 9) to identify emotions expressed without explicit sentiment words, focusing on context and event semantics.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Classification of 8 event categories (e.g., legal issues, physical pain)</li>
    <li>Implicit polarity detection without explicit sentiment keywords</li>
    <li>Multi-task deep learning model with evaluation metrics like F1-score</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p><strong>Skills Applied:</strong><br>
  Natural Language Processing (NLP), Text Classification, Python, Deep Learning, Model Evaluation</p>
