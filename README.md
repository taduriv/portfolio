**I worked at Amazon in multiple roles, both contract and full-time, which allowed me to progressively build and diversify my skills in operations, data analysis, and product quality. The transitions between these roles sometimes created short gaps, which I used productively to upskill and prepare for new challenges. This experience helped me adapt quickly, take on greater responsibilities, and develop a comprehensive expertise within the same organization.**

### HR Analysis-PowerBi
[Publication](https://github.com/taduriv/HR-Analytics-Dashboard)

This project showcases an interactive HR Analytics Dashboard built using Power BI, designed to analyze and visualize employee attendance data from April to June 2022.


Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
