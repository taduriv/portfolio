**I worked at Amazon in multiple roles, both contract and full-time, which allowed me to progressively build and diversify my skills in operations, data analysis, and product quality. The transitions between these roles sometimes created short gaps, which I used productively to upskill and prepare for new challenges. This experience helped me adapt quickly, take on greater responsibilities, and develop a comprehensive expertise within the same organization.**
