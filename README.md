## Work Experience
**Product Quality Operations – Product Authentication Team
Amazon | Oct 2020 – Jun 2023**
-Conducted data-driven investigations to restrict unauthorized sellers, contributing to the removal of 500+ counterfeit listings per quarter and protecting brand integrity.
-Verified inventory authenticity through 100+ supplier communications (calls/emails) weekly, ensuring compliance with Amazon’s brand protection policies.
-Analyzed seller profiles and transaction patterns, identifying 20+ high-risk seller networks involved in counterfeit activities across multiple marketplaces.
-Leveraged SQL and Excel (macros, lookups, pivot tables) to process and analyze datasets with 50K+ records/month, supporting fraud detection and decision-making.
-Monitored seller activities using Kibana, reviewing real-time data from 10+ operational dashboards to detect fraudulent behaviors and anomalies.
-Partnered with 5+ cross-functional teams including Business Analysts and ML Engineers to supply clean datasets and improve fraud detection algorithms.
-Identified 50+ regulatory non-compliant products monthly, helping reduce legal and reputational risks for the platform.
-Automated recurring reports, reducing manual processing time by 30%, improving investigation turnaround times.
-Supported complex seller investigations, accurately redirecting 100+ seller queries/month to specialized teams for resolution.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
